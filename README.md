# JSRockPaperScissors
Hello everyone,
this is a small javascript project for a basic rock paper scissors game. Admittedly, the background is a little loud, but it adds character to an otherwise boring game. Included in the repository is the HTML file, the image that was used for the background, and the CSS Stylesheet that formatted the design of the HTML page.

Thanks.
